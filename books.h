	\brief Item class for books
	\author Akron (complete rewrite)
	\todo write it....
	\todo create xss-based books

	There are two types of books, read only books, defined by scripters, in this case they are loaded
	from xss scripts and read/write books, wrote in game, that are saved to a save file on disk.

	Two books can have the same contents if it's defined by xss script, but not if they are
	read/write books.<br>
	For this reason, we need to duplicate the book's data if we are duping a book item, else we could
	have two books "linked" together, changing one, will change the other too.

	a read/write book is defined on the file like that (without tabs identation obviously :P):

	<pre>
	SECTION RWBOOK index
	{
		AUTHOR author
		TITLE title
		PAGE
		{
			LINE blablabla
			LINE bblalblal
		}
		PAGE
		{
			LINE blablabla

		PAGE
